<Note>

Sentry's SDKs report an error automatically whenever a thrown error or exception goes uncaught in your application causing the application to crash. Sentry's iOS, tvOS, and watchOS SDK hook into all signal and exception handlers, except for MacOS.

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk and tries to send the report right after the crash. Since the environment may be unstable at the crash time, the report is guaranteed to send once the application is started again.

**Features:**

- Limited symbolication support and no crash handling
- Events [enriched](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- [Attachments](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files
- [User Feedback](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/user-feedback/) provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs
